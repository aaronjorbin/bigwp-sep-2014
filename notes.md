Axiums are ideas we use to start our reasoning that are so fundamentaly true, we use them to define what is true. They come from a Greek term that roughly translates to 'that which commends itself as evident.' They are phrases as simple as:

A + B = B + A One look at this phrase and we understand the truth within it. Many different fields have Axiums. 	

We don't Have axiums for Websites

We can't have axiums for Websites. The axiums of logic have taken hundreds of years to develop. The Web hasn't been around for years.  

The Web is young. The web is only 25 years old. In 2004, less than 50% of the country was internet users.  That's only 14 years ago. While 100% of this room is internet users, over 10% of the country still doesn't use the Internet.

WordPress is even Younger than that.  10 years ago we lived in a pre facebook society.  However, What we did have was the release of WordPress 1.2 named for Charles Mingus.  WordPress 1.2 brought us some incredble features. 

Sub-categories - We no longer were limited to just 

Post preview - We could now see what our posts looked like BEFORE we published them. 
Of course, WordPress still didn't have a number of features that we have grown to love. We wouldn't have tags until 2007. 

What might even surpise you more, we wouldn't have Themes until the following year. 

Like I said, WordPress is Young. So since we don't have the depth of history and knowledge to have our own Axiums, what if we instead borrowed ideas from elsewhere.  

What if we Steal our Axiums and build off the ideas from other fields.  Tonight I'm going to present 3 of Akin's Laws of Spacecraft Design and explain how they can be the axioms for us as creators, builders and designers of the web. 

Now you may wonder why I choose to steal from Spacecraft Design when there are a number of fields with a number of ideas we can borrow.  The answer is as simple as Voyager 1.  It was launched 37 years ago this month.  It is predicted to have 11 more years of power.  It was scheduled to be used for just over 3 years. In the end, it will exceed expectations by over 15 fold. If we could get our systems to do that, we would be doing amazing.

The First law is akin's first law:

Engineering is done with &nbsp;numbers. Analysis without numbers is only an opinion.

Calling buidling websites Engineering is a bit of a controversy. But like Aerospace engineers:

We need Numbers.  Numbers, data and information help us make the best possible decisions. They help us figure out where we should out our resources. To get our numbers, we need to

Gather Numbers.  This happens in a number of ways.  We have tools like google analytics, mix panel, and AddThis to tell us how our users are using our pages. But that's only a part of the numbers we need. What about before we launch a site or a new major feature?  For that, we can turn to  

Load Testing.  Load testing is a simulation of traffic. It allows us to understand our traffic before that traffic takes down our sites.  The biggest question we need to ask is 

How <em>Much</em> is <em>Enough</em>?  This is a hard question.  It's not obvius. Luckily, we have a lot of information at our hands that we may not realize.

Our logs are available for us, if we take advantage of them. And it's simple to do so. We can use tools such as  

cat, grep, awk, sort and uniq to better understand our sites. If you write code more than rarely and aren't familiar with the basics for using these classic tools, your homework for tonight is to start getting familiar with them. 

Now when it comes to the actual load testing, you have a couple of options

Siege

Bees with Machine Guns


Numbers <em>Matter</em>

There is never a single right solution. There are always <em>multiple wrong ones</em>.
Make a lot of Mistakes
Only Make Them Once
Mistakes are gifts
Unit Tests
phpunit
qUnit
Tests are a data point
#3
You can't get to the <em>moon</em> by climbing successively taller trees.
Performance Testing
Speed Matters
Radical Changes
Cached Content means <em>Front End</em> matters most
phantomas
WebCacheGrind
Debug Bar
BYOT

These three axioms are all about creating new information and data. 

It's important that we use this data to INFORM, not drive our decisions.  Data, just like anything else isn't perfect.  

<em>Inform</em>, don't Drive
<em>$$$</em> Drives

Use our Axioms
While we do need to use our axioms.  

in the presence of good rationale, maintainers should be willing to change their mind often.
